Hi!

This addon for Blender3D (2.8 and newer) allows you to create an RGB node or a new material in accordance with the following color tables:

- RAL Classic,
- RAL Design,
- RAL Effect,
- Pantone,
- NCS.

You can also save any colors to favorites for quick access to them.

The selected colors are stored in the project root folder or in the Blender add-ons folder in "setcolordata" in the files "fav_dist.bin" and "fav_dict_id.bin".

Files with the selected colors are loaded automatically, in case of an error you can download manually by clicking the "download dictionary" button.

You can also choose how to load the dictionary - from the project root folder, or from the addon location folder (default)
