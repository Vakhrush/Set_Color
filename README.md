Authors: Vakhrushev N., Vakhrusheva A.

Hi!

This addon for Blender3D (2.8 and newer) allows you to create an RGB node or a new material in accordance with the following color tables:

- RAL Classic,
- RAL Design,
- RAL Effect,
- Pantone,
- NCS.

You can also save any colors to favorites for quick access to them.

The selected colors are saved in the root folder of the project in the folder "setcolordata" in the files "fav_dist.bin" and "fav_dict_id.bin".

Files with selected colors are loaded automatically, in case of an error, you can download manually by clicking the "load dictionary" button.
